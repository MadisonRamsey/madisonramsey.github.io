                <h3>Data Analytics Consulting Internship at DAS42</h3>
                <p>In summer 2019, I was one of 15 Cornell Engineers awarded with a Kessler Fellows grant to work at a start-up company of my choice. I decided to work at DAS42, a data analytics consulting company based in NYC. During my internship, I worked heavily with SQL, Snowflake, Fivetran, and Looker. I completed the following projects in my time there:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Looker Capstone Project</b></li>
                        <p>As a part of my initial training, I got to build Looker dashboards from scratch using datasets of my choosing. I decided to look at median zipcode income across the U.S. and analyze corresponding densities of different fast food chains, Starbucks, Walmarts, and Target Stores. Major takeaways of this project included enhancing my SQL skills, establishing quality assurance and data cleaning processes, and learning how to convey a story via data visualization.</p>
                    <li><b>Client Work with Fortune 500 Companies</b></li>
                        <p>I worked with two client companies in my time at DAS42. I helped client data teams standardize SQL code, implement data documentation, automate dashboard triggers, and resolve ticket requests from data analysts. Major milestones included writing SQL code that was deployed to production company wide and learning how to communicate with client data teams.</p>
                    <li><b>Internal Analytics "Executive Dashboard"</b></li>
                        <p>After learning how to extract, transfrom, and load data through DAS42's preferred data pipeline, I applied these skills to create a Looker dashboard for internal use by DAS42 executives. The dashboard leverages employee-inputed time tracking data to enable executives to see how analysts divide time between different projects, meetings, trainings, travel, etc. </p>
                    <li><b>Comittee Work</b></li>
                        <p>Working at a small company allowed me to wear many hats and work on several comittess of my choosing. I participated in the recruitment and on-boarding comittees, implementing ideas to attract new recruits and creating an on-baoarding timeline/template for training new hires. I also created newsletters as a part of the marketing comittee and organized a day of comunity service as a part of the service and giving comittee.   </p>
                </ul>
